   note: the above summary is an indication of how the chance estimates interact with
         the decision variables. A large variation in the standard deviation across
         the chance point locations indicates that there is non-trivial interaction
         between the chance estimates and the decision variables.

   note: the above summary is an indication of how the chance estimates interact with
         the decision variables. A large variation in the standard deviation across
         the chance point locations indicates that there is non-trivial interaction
         between the chance estimates and the decision variables.

   note: the above summary is an indication of how the chance estimates interact with
         the decision variables. A large variation in the standard deviation across
         the chance point locations indicates that there is non-trivial interaction
         between the chance estimates and the decision variables.

   note: the above summary is an indication of how the chance estimates interact with
         the decision variables. A large variation in the standard deviation across
         the chance point locations indicates that there is non-trivial interaction
         between the chance estimates and the decision variables.

   note: the above summary is an indication of how the chance estimates interact with
         the decision variables. A large variation in the standard deviation across
         the chance point locations indicates that there is non-trivial interaction
         between the chance estimates and the decision variables.

   note: the above summary is an indication of how the chance estimates interact with
         the decision variables. A large variation in the standard deviation across
         the chance point locations indicates that there is non-trivial interaction
         between the chance estimates and the decision variables.
